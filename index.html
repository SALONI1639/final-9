Vyasa narrating the Mahābhārata to Ganesha from a 17th century Mewar manuscript.
The epic is traditionally ascribed to the sage Vyasa, who is also a major figure in the epic.[12] Vyasa described it as being an itihasa (transl. history).<br> He also describes the Guru–shishya tradition, which traces all great teachers and their students of the Vedic times.

The first section of the Mahābhārata states that it was Ganesha who wrote down the text to Vyasa's dictation, but this is regarded by scholars as a later interpolation to the epic and the "Critical Edition" does not include Ganesha.[17]

The epic employs the story within a story structure, otherwise known as frametales, popular in many Indian religious and non-religious works.<br> It is first recited at Takshashila by the sage Vaisampayana,[18][19] a disciple of Vyasa, to the King Janamejaya who was the great-grandson of the Pandava prince Arjuna.<br> The story is then recited again by a professional storyteller named Ugrashrava Sauti, many years later,<br> to an assemblage of sages performing the 12-year sacrifice for the king Saunaka Kulapati in the Naimisha Forest.


Sauti recites the slokas of the Mahabharata.
The text was described by some early 20th-century Indologists as unstructured and chaotic. Hermann Oldenberg supposed that the original poem must once have carried an immense "tragic force" but dismissed the full text as a "horrible chaos."[20] Moritz Winternitz (Geschichte der indischen Literatur 1909) considered that "only unpoetical theologists and clumsy scribes" could have lumped the parts of disparate origin into an unordered whole.</p>
